LaTeX files for Independent Study at The College of Wooster

The purpose of this project is to provide you with a template for typesetting your IS using LaTeX. LaTeX is very similar to HTML in the sense that it is a markup language. What does this mean? Well, basically it means you need only enter the commands for structuring your IS, i.e., identify chapters, sections, subsections, equations, quotes, etc. You do not need to worry about any of the formatting. The woosterthesis class takes care of all of the formatting.

woosterthesis loads a number of packages by default and several others through class options; it is assumed you have these installed on your system. They are: alltt, amsfonts,
amsmath, amssymb, amsthm. babel, biblatex, biblatex-chicago, caption, csquotes, eso-pic, eucal, eufrak, fancyhdr, float, floatflt, fontenc, fontspec, geometry, graphicx, hyperref, ifpdf, ifthen,
ifxetex, inputenc, lettrine, listings, lmodern, makeidx, maple2e, microtype, pdftex, polyglossia, pxfonts, setspace, subfig, textpos, TikZ, verbatim, wrapfig, xcolor,
xltxtra, and xunicode. The woosterthesis class assumes you are using pdfTeX (support for postscript based TeX has been dropped as of 2006/17/11).

The file usermanual.pdf explains how to use the template.
