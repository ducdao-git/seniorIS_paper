\chapter{Experiments: Mask R-CNN and YOLOv5 Comparision} \label{chap:experiments}

We perform a comparison between the Mask R-CNN and the YOLOv5 algorithm on the object detection task. The comparison software can be obtained at the seniorIS\_code repository owned by ducdao-git \cite{experiment_repo}. We use 16,445 annotated images in the validation set of the nuImages dataset. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the nuImages dataset and describe the implementation of the metrics we employed in our experiment program. Finally, we will discuss the performance of the two models.
