\chapter{Experiments: Mask R-CNN and YOLOv5 Comparision} \label{chap:experiments}

We perform a comparision between the Mask R-CNN and the YOLOv5 algorithm on the object detection task. We use 16,445 anotated images in the validation set of the nuImages dataset. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the nuImages dataset and describe the metrics implementation we employed in our experiment program. Finally, we will discuss the performance of the two models.
