\chapter{R-CNN Variation} \label{chap:rcnn_variation}

Since the interested domain for this paper is the object detection and instance segmentation task, we will analyze the Mask R-CNN. Mask R-CNN is a popular algorithm that tries to solve both object detection and instance segmentation problem in the Computer Vision field. However, Mask R-CNN is the improved version of Faster R-CNN and Fast R-CNN, which is based on the R-CNN algorithm. Therefore, to fully understand Mask R-CNN, we will start with understanding the building block of R-CNN, which is designed for object detection task only.
