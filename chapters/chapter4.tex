\chapter{YOLO Variation} \label{chap:yolo_variation}

In addition to the Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) family, the other model family we will discuss in this section is You Only Look Once (YOLO). Similar to the R-CNN family, the YOLO family is also designed to perform object detection and can be expanded to other tasks like instance segmentation or semantic segmentation. However, unlike the R-CNN family, the model in the YOLO family frames the object detection task as a single-stage regression problem instead of a double-stage regression problem \cite{yolov3_2018}. 

The models in the R-CNN family are considered as double-stage methods because the model generates a region of interest (RoI) and classifies each RoI using two different algorithms or networks. That is, while RoI generation can be done with a greedy algorithm (like Selective Search) or a fully connected convolutional network (like RPN), the model uses another CNN for feature extraction (like AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet) and adapt it to perform classification for each generated RoI \cite{Girshick_R_CNN_2013, fast_rcnn_og, faster_rcnn_2015}. For this reason, the object detection task is separated into two tasks: localization task and classification task, where each task is completed by a different network.

On the other hand, the models in the YOLO family is utilized a single convolution neural network to simultaneously predict both the bounding box and the classification label for each object in the input image \cite{yolov1_2016}. Therefore YOLO model family is designed to only evaluate an image once with a single CNN for the object detection task. Hence the name You Only Look Once. In this chapter, we will discuss different versions of the YOLO model.
