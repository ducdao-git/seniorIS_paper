\chapter{YOLO Variation} \label{chap:yolo_variation}

In addition to the Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) family, the other family of model we will discuss in this section is You Only Look Once (YOLO). Similar to R-CNN family, YOLO family also designed to perform object detection and can be expand to other task like instance segmentation or semantic segmentation. However, unlike R-CNN family, the model in YOLO family frame the object detection task as a single stage regression problem instead of double stage regression problem {\color{red} cite yolov3}. 

The models in R-CNN family is consider as double stage method because the model first try to generate region of interest (RoI), then classify each ROI using two different algorithm or network. That is, while RoI generation can be done with a greedy algorithm (like Selective Search) or a fully connected convolutional network (like RPN), the model use another CNN for feature extraction (like AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet) and adapt it to perform classfication for each generated RoI \cite{Girshick_R_CNN_2013, fast_rcnn_og, faster_rcnn_2015}. For this reason, the object detection task is seperate into two tasks: localization task and classfication task, where each task is completed by a different network.

On the other hand, the models in YOLO family is utilized a single convolution neural network to simultaneously predict both bounding box and the classfication label for each object in the input image \cite{yolov1_2016}. Therefore YOLO model family is designed to only evaluate an image once with a single CNN for object detection task. Hence the name You Only Look Once. In this chapter we will disscuss different version of YOLO model.
