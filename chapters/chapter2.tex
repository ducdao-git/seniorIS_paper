With the understanding of object detection, instance segmentation, and their evaluation metrics, we will discuss R-CNN and YOLO, the two most popular algorithm families in these tasks, in Chapter \ref{chap:rcnn_variation} and \ref{chap:yolo_variation}, respectively. In Section \ref{sec:cnn}, we discussed the structure and building blocks of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We also stated how CNNs classify objects in the image classification task in the discussion. However,  the image classification task assumes the image has exactly one object, and the model classifies the entire image based on that one object. Therefore, if we consider each bounding box as its own image, we can utilize a CNN to identify the object's class within the bounding box. This is the main idea behind the different variations of R-CNN and YOLO, which are designed for object detection and instance segmentation task.
